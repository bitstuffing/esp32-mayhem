# ESP32-MAYHEM 
Just a custom implementation to use the old TTGO with his integrated GPS 
and explore the hardware mod using ESP32 gadgets with PortaPack.

It needs a lot of work, now everything just it's a mockup and dummy functionality, 
it's just a PoC with old ESP32 hardware with a custom implementation of I2C slave.
